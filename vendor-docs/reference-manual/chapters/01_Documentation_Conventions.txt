Description

Software can read as well as clear this bit by writing 1. Writing ‘0’ has no effect
on the bit value.
Software can read as well as clear this bit by writing 0. Writing ‘1’ has no effect
on the bit value.
Software can read this bit. Reading this bit automatically clears it to ‘0’. Writing
‘0’ has no effect on the bit value.
Software can read as well as set this bit. Writing ‘0’ has no effect on the bit
value.
Software can read this bit. Writing ‘0’ or ‘1’ triggers an event but has no effect on
the bit value.
Software can only toggle this bit by writing ‘1’. Writing ‘0’ has no effect
Reserved bit, must be kept at reset value.
