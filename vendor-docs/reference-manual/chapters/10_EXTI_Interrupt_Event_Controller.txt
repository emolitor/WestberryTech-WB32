Interrupt/event controller (EXTI)

10.1.

Overview
EXTI (interrupt/event controller) contains up to 19 independent edge detectors and
generates interrupt requests or events to the processor. The EXTI has three trigger types:
rising edge, falling edge and both edges. Each edge detector in the EXTI can be configured
and masked independently.

External Interrupt and Event function overview
The EXTI contains up to 19 independent edge detectors and generates interrupts request or
event to the processor. The EXTI has three trigger types: rising edge, falling edge and both
edges. Each edge detector in the EXTI can be configured and masked independently.
The EXTI trigger source includes 16 external lines from GPIO pins and 4 lines from internal
modules (including LVD, RTC Alarm, USB Wakeup).All GPIO pins can be selected as an
EXTI trigger source by configuring AFIO_EXTI registers.
EXTI can provide not only interrupts but also event signals to the processor. The Cortex-M3
processor fully implements the Wait FOR Interrupt (WFI), Wait FOR Event (WFE) and the
Send Event (SEV) instructions. The Wake-up Interrupt Controller (WIC) enables the
processor and NVIC to be put into a very low-power sleep mode leaving the WIC to identify
and prioritize interrupts and event. EXTI can be used to wake up processor and the whole
system when some expected event occurs, such as a special GPIO pin toggling or RTC
alarm.
