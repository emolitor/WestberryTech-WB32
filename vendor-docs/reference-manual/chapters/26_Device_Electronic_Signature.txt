WB32FQ95xx Reference Manual

26.

Device electronic signature

26.1.

Overview
This Section applies to the whole WB32FQ95xx family, unless otherwise specified.
The electronic signature is stored in the System memory area in the Flash memory module,
and can be read using the SWD or the CPU. It contains factory-programmed identification
data that allow the user firmware or other external devices to automatically match its
interface to the characteristics of the WB32FQ95xx microcontroller.

26.2.

Memory size registers
Flash size register
Base address: 0x4001 6404
Read only = 0xXXXX where X is factory-programmed
Please refer to section 3.3.2 in SYS for detail

26.3.

Unique device ID register (96 bits)
The unique device identifier is ideally suited:
⚫

for use as serial numbers (for example USB string serial numbers or other end
applications)

⚫

for use as security keys in order to increase the security of code in Flash memory while
using and combining this unique ID with software cryptographic primitives and protocols
before programming the internal Flash memory to activate secure boot processes, etc.

The 96-bit unique device identifier provides a reference number which is unique for any
device and in any context. These bits can never be altered by the user.
The 96-bit unique device identifier can also be read in single bytes/half-words/words in
different ways and then be concatenated using a custom algorithm.
Address: 0x1FFFF7E8
Read only = 0xXXXX where X is factory-programmed
